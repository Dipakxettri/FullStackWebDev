    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- 
      This <meta> tag sets the viewport for responsive design. 
      The 'width=device-width' part ensures the webpage fits the screen size of the device,
      while 'initial-scale=1.0' ensures no zoom is applied when the page loads.

    <title>Basic HTML Structure</title>
    <!-- 
      The <title> tag defines the title of the webpage, 
      which appears in the browser tab or window title.
